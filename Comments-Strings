Not bad!  A good transition from integers to Strings.

One small issue: the formenting and indentation on getMinIndex got a bit out of whack.
One larger issue: getMaxIndex doesn't properly update the maxString, so it actually returns the last item that is greater than the first.
Two ways to fix it:
  (1) include another line in the "if" [like you have in getMinIndex], or 
  (2) instead of comparing to maxString, compare to arrayData[pos].  You *do* correctly update pos if you get a later String.
  
Good work overall.  9/10
